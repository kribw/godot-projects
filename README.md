# 👾 Godot projects
Godot projects from the master's course 🎓 [Applied Computer Science](https://en.uit.no/education/program/446261/applied_computer_science_-_master) at UiT.

## 📁 fluid_mechanics
📖 [DTE-3600 Fluid Mechanics](https://en.uit.no/education/courses/course?p_document_id=765885&ar=2022&semester=H)

Godot simulation visualizing how the downdraft from the [SAR Queen helicopter](https://www.forsvaret.no/om-forsvaret/utstyr-og-materiell?ark=SAR%20Queen) affects nearby areas at the University Hospital of Northern Norway in Tromsø. The data used was acquired from real-world sensors, then exported from [FLOW-3D](https://www.flow3d.com/).

## 📁 sphero_simulator
📖 [DTE-3605 Virtual reality, Graphics and Animation - project](https://uit.no/utdanning/emner/emne?p_document_id=765882)

Two-part project where movement data from a [Sphero BOLT](https://sphero.com/products/sphero-bolt) was used to create a visual simulation in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). 

📑 [Report, part one: Preliminary assessment and intended implementation.](https://github.com/kribw/godot-projects/blob/main/sphero_simulator/part-1-kwi059.pdf)

📑 [Report, part two: Resulting implementation with visual simulation.](https://github.com/kribw/godot-projects/blob/main/sphero_simulator/part-2-kwi059.pdf)

## 📁 squash_the_creeps_start_1.1.0
- [Squash the creeps - Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html)
- Implementation of "Your first 3D game" to get started with Godot.
